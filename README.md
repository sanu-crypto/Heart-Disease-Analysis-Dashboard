# Heart-Disease-Analysis-Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
#Heart_Disease_DATASET
This project analyzes patient health data to understand survival rates, mortality factors, and risk indicators for heart disease. A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize patterns across age groups, gender, and key medical biomarkers such as serum creatinine and ejection fraction.

The goal is to support early detection, risk stratification, and better decision-making in healthcare.

📊 Features of the Dashboard

Overall KPIs: Survival Rate, Total Deaths, Total Survivors, Average Age of Survival.

Risk Factor Impact: Smoking, High Blood Pressure, Anaemia, and Diabetes across different age groups.

Survival by Age Group: Identifies how survival rate declines with age.

Biomarker Analysis:

Serum Creatinine vs Death Events

Ejection Fraction vs Survival

Gender Comparison: Male vs Female outcomes.

🔎 Key Insights

Average Survival Rate: ~67–68%.

Age Factor: Survival is highest below 40 (100%) and lowest above 71 (~40%).

Biomarkers:

High serum creatinine (>1.2) is linked to higher death events.

Low ejection fraction (<38) is associated with poor survival.

Gender Differences: Females have a slightly better survival rate than males.

Middle-aged (40–70 yrs) patients with comorbidities (smoking, diabetes, hypertension) face the highest risk.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop (for dashboard development)

Dataset: Heart disease patient records (includes age, gender, survival, comorbidities, biomarkers).
