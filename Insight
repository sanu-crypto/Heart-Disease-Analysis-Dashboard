ðŸ”¹ Key Insights from the Dashboard
1. Overall Performance

Survival Rate: ~67%â€“68% (majority of patients survive).

Total Deaths: 34â€“96 (varies by gender selection).

Total Survivors: 71â€“203.

Average Age of Survival: ~58 years.

2. Risk Factors (by Age Group)

Smoking, High Blood Pressure, Anaemia, and Diabetes are strongly clustered in ages 51â€“70.

Below 40, lifestyle diseases have much less impact.

3. Survival Rate by Age

Highest survival is in young patients (<40 yrs: up to 100%).

Survival declines with age:

40â€“50 yrs â†’ ~70â€“76%

51â€“60 yrs â†’ ~60â€“75%

61â€“70 yrs â†’ ~70â€“74%

71+ yrs â†’ ~40%

ðŸ‘‰ Elderly patients (71+) have the lowest survival (40%).

4. Biomarker Insights

Serum Creatinine (indicator of kidney/heart stress):

Elevated in deaths (1.2â€“1.5 on average).

Higher creatinine correlates with higher death count.

Ejection Fraction (heart pumping efficiency):

Survivors have better ejection fraction (~41â€“44).

Low values (<38) appear in groups with higher death counts.

ðŸ‘‰ Low ejection fraction + high creatinine strongly predict mortality.

5. Gender-Based Insights

Dashboard shows different survival rates for male and female patients:

Females: ~68% survival, 62 deaths, 132 survivors.

Males: ~67.6% survival, 34 deaths, 71 survivors.

Women have a slightly better survival rate overall, though men have fewer deaths (possibly fewer male patients in dataset).

ðŸ”¹ Actionable Findings

Elderly patients (71+) are the most vulnerable â†’ need early intervention & monitoring.

High serum creatinine and low ejection fraction are strong mortality predictors â†’ should be part of routine check-ups.

Lifestyle diseases (smoking, hypertension, diabetes) impact middle-aged (40â€“70) patients most. Preventive measures in this age group can improve survival.

Female patients show marginally better survival â†’ could indicate differences in treatment response or risk exposure.

âœ… This dashboard effectively shows which groups need more medical focus (elderly, high creatinine, low EF, comorbid patients) and gives a data-driven basis for improving patient outcomes.
